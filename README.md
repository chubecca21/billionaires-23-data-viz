# Billionaires of 2023 Exploratory Data Analysis

This notebook contains data preparation for the data visualisation, [Billionaires of 2023](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rebecca.chu/viz/Billionairesof2023/Dashboard1) on Tableau Public.

Since the pandemic in 2020, the five richest men in the world have doubled their fortunes, whilst almost five billion people globally have become poorer. The monopolisation of corporations has exacerbated wealth inequality, allowing power to be concentrated among the select few. A report by Oxfam found that at current rates, it would take 230 years to end poverty but only 10 years before we could see our first trillionaire. This analysis explores the billionaires of 2023.
